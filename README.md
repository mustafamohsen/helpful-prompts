# Helpful Prompts

A curated collection of powerful prompts designed to **extend, restart, or transfer** high-quality conversations across LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others.

Each prompt in this repo is crafted to solve a recurring problem in how people interact with large language models—from summarizing full threads into actionable prompts, to debugging models, to resuming context-aware discussions without transcript copying.
